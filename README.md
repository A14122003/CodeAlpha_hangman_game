# CodeAlpha_hangman_game
This is a GUI-based Hangman Game built using Python (Tkinter). The game randomly selects a word, and the player has to guess it letter by letter. With each wrong guess, the number of lives decreases. The player wins if they guess the word correctly before running out of lives.
